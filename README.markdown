last.fm
=======
*a very simple client library for last.fm and ruby*

This is something I am throwing together for use in a larger project I am working on. I have no intention of making things significantly more complicated than just grabbing the most recent tracks from a user and(eventually) adding some sort of a capability to get the recently played tracks as a lazy stream(such that you can go back as far as you would like in the track history without having to process it all at once.)
